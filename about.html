			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>My name is Parmashawn, I am the sole creator of this site. I started playing Pixelworlds since before global release.
			Funny enough, I don't grind or farm in the game very much, I like to spend my time creating Pixelworlds related creations.
			<b>Pixelworlds Gems</b> is a free site developed by me as an easy way to calculate gems. The original idea of a gem calculating site is not mine.
			credit for that goes to someone else. My goal with creating this site is to learn more about programming and to add some features which I felt were missing from other solutions.
			Overall I enjoyed creating pwgems.com and I hope that many pixelworlds players will use it often.</p>
